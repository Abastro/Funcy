# Funcy
Funcy, functional language with simplistic concepts. Should be addictive!

Funcy is a language around idea of mathematical functions.
Also, Compound is important in funcy - it's an easy way to introduce normal code for one-parameter function world.
There is an interface function and simple function - interface function usually serves its role as a type.
Here, 'Type value' means : the function 'value' inherits the function 'Type'. Surprisingly, it works well as traditional view on type.
Inheritance is like this: The child function needs to be defined for all domain of the parent function, mapping all value to the codomain of the parent function.
